# Template generator for employee info
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. [Here is a walk through]() of the app's functionality.

## Description

This is a command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of managers, engineers, and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
The application relies heavily on class syntax to generate instances of employees.
